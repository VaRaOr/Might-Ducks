        </p>
        <b>SPORTSMANSHIP</b>
        <p>
          The common interest that members of the Association share is to
          inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
          Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
          whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
          action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
          accomplishments or standing.
        </p>
        <b>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>DIMENSIONS</b> .IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field
            dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length.
            These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
            under 12 and older.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b> Fields used within the competition
            program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or
            associations participating in the state competition program that are
            unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must
            advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields
            Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or
            not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
            leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
            acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS.</b> a. U-6 play on a field
            approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields for older
            age groups should be progressively larger. b. U-8 plays on a field
            40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width. c. U-10 play on a field
            70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width. d. In addition,
            fields used by young age groups may have their internal dimensions
            and size of goal similarly modified.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <b>ALL-PLAY.</b>
        <p>
          All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play
          atleast fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program
          are encouraged to play their players 50% of each game. o A Coach shall
          be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game under special
          circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice and/or games,
          ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or games, and injuries.
